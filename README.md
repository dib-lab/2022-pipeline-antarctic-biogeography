## Biogeography Study of Antarctic Cyanobacteria

This repository contains code for sourmash branchwater biogeography search validation mapping with genome-grist and assembly of metagenome hits. `conf-antarctic.yml` is the file used for [genome-grist](https://github.com/dib-lab/genome-grist) v0.9.0.

The code to generate the metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) is at [https://github.com/jessicalumian/vanda_mags](https://github.com/jessicalumian/vanda_mags) and [https://github.com/jessicalumian/fryxell-phormidium](https://github.com/jessicalumian/fryxell-phormidium).

The SRA-wide branchwater search is described at: [https://dib-lab.github.io/2022-paper-branchwater-software/](https://dib-lab.github.io/2022-paper-branchwater-software/)

Jupyter Notebook for searching: [https://hub.binder.pangeo.io/user/luizirber-2020-09-06-jct-3b3e9wdj/lab](https://hub.binder.pangeo.io/user/luizirber-2020-09-06-jct-3b3e9wdj/lab)
